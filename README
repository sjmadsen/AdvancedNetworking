This is the demo code for my Advanced Cocoa Networking talk.

PubSub shows how to run a Faye Ruby server and subscribe to messages sent to
a channel from within an iOS app.

SimpleEcho is a simple TCP echo client and server in a single Mac app. The
server runs on port 5000.

BonjourEcho modifies SimpleEcho to bind to an ephemeral port and advertise
the _lys-echo._tcp service using Bonjour. If the client finds more than one
system advertising the service, it will pick one at random. A more serious
implementation would present a UI with the available services and allow
the user to pick one.

GameKitChat demonstrates a very simple use of GameKit P2P networking.
